# Yukki

This is yet uh-nother wiki. It is written mainly in Perl and has some feature
ideas stolen from MojoMojo. It uses git to store all documents and files.

If you download it from github, you will need to install it using Dist::Zilla.

The preferred installation would be to fetch it from CPAN:

  cpanm Yukki

or if you don't have App::cpanminus installed (you should), you can run:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Yukki'
