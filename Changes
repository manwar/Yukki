    * Bugfix: Links sometimes treated whitespace incorrectly
    * Bugfix: Escaping links did not work in some cases
    * Up until now passwords were stored in plain text. They will no be stored
      as a salted hash using the digest configured in the digest directory (or
      SHA-512 if not given). If someone out there has been trying this out, you
      MUST run yukki-passwd for every user to hash the passwords.
    * Added the yukki-passwd script to help with password changes.
    * Added the first few unit tests.
    * The configuration file is now checked for correctness when it is loaded.
